		LunchMoney Lewis - Bills<br>
		<br>
		I got bills I gotta pay<br>
        So I'ma gon' work, work, work every day<br>
        I got mouths I gotta feed<br>
        So I'ma gon' make sure everybody eats<br>
        I got bills<br>
        <br>
        All these bills pile up my desk<br>
        They looking like a mount<br>
        All the little kids run around<br>
        I can hear their stomach growl<br>
        There's a full moon out<br>
        And my girl just keep on howlin'<br>
        Said she gonna leave me if I don't home with fifty thousand<br>
        Fifty thousand? Ah damn, ah damn, ah damn, ah damn<br>
        Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man<br>
        Ah damn, oh man, ah damn, oh man<br>
        <br>
        I got bills I gotta pay<br>
        So I'm gon' work, work, work every day<br>
        I got mouths I gotta feed<br>
        So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats<br>
        I got bills<br>
        <br>
        Woke up and I bumped my head<br>
        Stumped my toe on the edge of the bed<br>
        Opened the fridge and the food all gone<br>
        Neighbor's damn dog done crapped on my lawn<br>
        Hopped in the car and the car won't start<br>
        It's too damn hot but I still gotta walk<br>
        Behind an old lady in the grocery line<br>
        Praying that my card won't get declined<br>
        Ah damn, ah damn, ah damn, ah damn<br>
        Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man<br>
        Ah damn, oh man, ah damn, oh man<br>
        <br>
        I got bills I gotta pay<br>
        So I'm gon' work, work, work every day<br>
        I got mouths I gotta feed<br>
        So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats<br>
        I got<br>
        <br>
        And my shoes, my shoes<br>
        I said my shoes<br>
        Ain't got no soul<br>
        <br>
        I got bills I gotta pay<br>
        So I'm gon' work, work, work every day<br>
        I got mouths I gotta feed<br>
        So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats<br>
        I got bills I gotta pay<br>
        So I'm gon' work, work, work every day<br>
        I got mouths I gotta feed<br>
        So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats<br>
        I got bills<br>
        <br>
        Yo momma got bills, yo daddy got bills<br>
        Yo sister got bills, Yo auntie got bills (I got bills)<br>
        Yo uncle got bills<br>
        Everybody got bills, everybody got bills, uh</p>

		Electric Light Orchestra - Mr. Blue Sky	<br>
		<br>	
        Sun is shinin' in the sky<br>
        There ain't a cloud in sight<br>
        It's stopped rainin' everybody's in the play<br>
        And don't you know<br>
        It's a beautiful new day, hey hey<br>
        <br>
        Runnin' down the avenue<br>
        See how the sun shines brightly in the city<br>
        On the streets where once was pity<br>
        Mr. Blue Sky is living here today, hey hey<br>
        <br>
        Mr. Blue Sky please tell us why<br>
        You had to hide away for so long (so long)<br>
        Where did we go wrong?<br>
        <br>
        Mr. Blue Sky please tell us why<br>
        You had to hide away for so long (so long)<br>
        Where did we go wrong?<br>
        <br>
        Hey you with the pretty face<br>
        Welcome to the human race<br>
        A celebration, Mr. Blue Sky's up there waitin'<br>
        And today is the day we've waited for<br>
        <br>
        Oh Mr. Blue Sky please tell us why<br>
        You had to hide away for so long (so long)<br>
        Where did we go wrong?<br>
        <br>
        Hey there Mr. Blue<br>
        We're so pleased to be with you<br>
        Look around see what you do<br>
        Everybody smiles at you<br>
        <br>
        Hey there Mr. Blue<br>

        Everybody smiles at you<br>
        <br>
        Mr. Blue, you did it right<br>
        But soon comes Mr. Night creepin' over<br>
        Now his hand is on your shoulder<br>
        Never mind I'll remember you this<br>
        I'll remember you this way<br>
        <br>
        Mr. Blue Sky please tell us why<br>
        You had to hide away for so long (so long)<br>
        Where did we go wrong?<br>
        <br>
        Hey there Mr. Blue (sky)<br>
