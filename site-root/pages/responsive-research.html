<h2>EM</h2>
	<p class="em">
	An em is a unit in the field of typography, equal to the currently specified point size. For example, one em in a 16-point typeface is 16 points. Therefore, this unit is the same for all typefaces at a given point size.[1]<br>
	Typographic measurements using this unit are frequently expressed in decimal notation (e.g., 0.7 em) or as fractions of 100 or 1000 (e.g. 70/100 em or 700/1000 em).<br>
	The name "em" was originally a reference to the width of the capital "M" in the typeface and size being used, which was often the same as the point size.<br>

<h2>REM</h2>
	<p class="rem">
	CSS3 introduces a few new units, including the rem unit, which stands for "root em". If this hasn't put you to sleep yet, then let's look at how rem works.
	<br>
	The em unit is relative to the font-size of the parent, which causes the compounding issue. The rem unit is relative to the root—or the html—element. That means that we can define a single font size on the html element and define all rem units to be a percentage of that.<br>

<h2>PERCENTAGE</h2>
	<p class="percentage">
	The percentage CSS data types represent a percentage value. Many CSS properties can take percentage values, often to define sizes in terms of parent objects. Percentages are formed by a number immediately followed by the percentage sign %. Just as is the case with all other units in CSS, there isn't a space between the '%' and the number.
	<br>
	Many length properties use percentages, such as width, margin and padding. Percentages can also be seen in font-size, where the size of the text is directly related to the size of its parent.<br>

<h2>BOX SIZING</h2>
	<p class="main">
	The box-sizing CSS property is used to alter the default CSS box model used to calculate widths and heights of elements. It is possible to use this property to emulate the behavior of browsers that do not correctly support the CSS box model specification.
	</p>
	<div class="content">
	<p>Values:<br>
		content-box:<br>
			This is the default style as specified by the CSS standard. The width and height properties are measured including only the content, but not the padding, border or margin. <br>Note: Padding, border & margin will be outside of the box e.g. IF .box {width: 350px}; THEN you apply {border: 10px solid black;} RESULT {rendered in the browser} .box {width: 370px;}</p>
	<p>padding-box:<br>
			The width and height properties include the padding size, and do not include the border or margin.</p>
	<p class="border">border-box:<br>
			The width and height properties include the padding and border, but not the margin. This is the box model used by Internet Explorer when the document is in Quirks mode. Note: Padding & border will be inside of the box e.g. IF .box {width: 350px}; THEN you apply {border: 10px solid black;} RESULT {rendered in the browser} .box {width: 350px;}</p></div>

<h2>VW</h2>
	<p class="vw">
	Often times, there are certain elements within our design that we'd like to ensure can fit into the viewport in their entirety. Normally, we'd have to use JavaScript to do this. Check the size of the viewport and then resize any elements on the page accordingly. If the user resizes the browser then the script runs again to resize the elements on the page.<br>
	With vw/vh, we can size elements to be relative to the size of the viewport. The vw/vh units are interesting in that 1 unit reflects 1/100th the width of the viewport. To make an element the full width of the viewport, for example, you'd set it to width:100vw.<br>
