<header><h1>Money</h1></header>
<p>Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes, in a particular country or socio-economic context. The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value and sometimes, a standard of deferred payment. Any item or verifiable record that fulfils these functions can be considered as money.<br>
<br>
Money is historically an emergent market phenomenon establishing a commodity money, but nearly all contemporary money systems are based on fiat money. Fiat money, like any check or note of debt, is without use value as a physical commodity. It derives its value by being declared by a government to be legal tender; that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for "all debts, public and private". Counterfeit money can cause good money to lose its value.<br>
<br>
The money supply of a country consists of currency (banknotes and coins) and, depending on the particular definition used, one or more types of bank money (the balances held in checking accounts, savings accounts, and other types of bank accounts). Bank money, which consists only of records (mostly computerized in modern banking), forms by far the largest part of broad money in developed countries. <br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>

<p>I got bills I gotta pay<br>
So I'ma gon' work, work, work every day<br>
I got mouths I gotta feed<br>
So I'ma gon' make sure everybody eats<br>
I got bills<br>
<br>
All these bills pile up my desk<br>
They looking like a mount<br>
All the little kids run around<br>
I can hear their stomach growl<br>
There's a full moon out<br>
And my girl just keep on howlin'<br>
Said she gonna leave me if I don't home with fifty thousand<br>
Fifty thousand? Ah damn, ah damn, ah damn, ah damn<br>
Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man<br>
Ah damn, oh man, ah damn, oh man<br>
<br>
I got bills I gotta pay<br>
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day<br>
I got mouths I gotta feed<br>
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats<br>
I got bills<br>
<br>
Woke up and I bumped my head<br>
Stumped my toe on the edge of the bed<br>
Opened the fridge and the food all gone<br>
Neighbor's damn dog done crapped on my lawn<br>
Hopped in the car and the car won't start<br>
It's too damn hot but I still gotta walk<br>
Behind an old lady in the grocery line<br>
Praying that my card won't get declined<br>
Ah damn, ah damn, ah damn, ah damn<br>
Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man<br>
Ah damn, oh man, ah damn, oh man<br>
<br>
I got bills I gotta pay<br>
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day<br>
I got mouths I gotta feed<br>
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats<br>
I got<br>
<br>
And my shoes, my shoes<br>
I said my shoes<br>
Ain't got no soul<br>
<br>
I got bills I gotta pay<br>
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day<br>
I got mouths I gotta feed<br>
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats<br>
I got bills I gotta pay<br>
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day<br>
I got mouths I gotta feed<br>
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats<br>
I got bills<br>
<br>
Yo momma got bills, yo daddy got bills<br>
Yo sister got bills, Yo auntie got bills (I got bills)<br>
Yo uncle got bills<br>
Everybody got bills, everybody got bills, uh</p>

<p>Sun is shinin' in the sky<br>
There ain't a cloud in sight<br>
It's stopped rainin' everybody's in the play<br>
And don't you know<br>
It's a beautiful new day, hey hey<br>
<br>
Runnin' down the avenue<br>
See how the sun shines brightly in the city<br>
On the streets where once was pity<br>
Mr. Blue Sky is living here today, hey hey<br>
<br>
Mr. Blue Sky please tell us why<br>
You had to hide away for so long (so long)<br>
Where did we go wrong?<br>
<br>
Mr. Blue Sky please tell us why<br>
You had to hide away for so long (so long)<br>
Where did we go wrong?<br>
<br>
Hey you with the pretty face<br>
Welcome to the human race<br>
A celebration, Mr. Blue Sky's up there waitin'<br>
And today is the day we've waited for<br>
<br>
Oh Mr. Blue Sky please tell us why<br>
You had to hide away for so long (so long)<br>
Where did we go wrong?<br>
<br>
Hey there Mr. Blue<br>
We're so pleased to be with you<br>
Look around see what you do<br>
Everybody smiles at you<br>
<br>
Hey there Mr. Blue<br>
We're so pleased to be with you<br>
Look around see what you do<br>
Everybody smiles at you<br>
<br>
Mr. Blue, you did it right<br>
But soon comes Mr. Night creepin' over<br>
Now his hand is on your shoulder<br>
Never mind I'll remember you this<br>
I'll remember you this way<br>
<br>
Mr. Blue Sky please tell us why<br>
You had to hide away for so long (so long)<br>
Where did we go wrong?<br>
<br>
Hey there Mr. Blue (sky)<br>
We're so pleased to be with you (sky)<br>
Look around see what you do (blue)<br>
Everybody smiles at you<br>
