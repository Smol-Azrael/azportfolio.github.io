                    This time travel in Malaysia was more like being relaxed and chill than being inspirational or studying and learning. Thinking about myself, others, and also, I think I somehow improved my skill in taking pictures with my phone.</br>
                    After six and a half of flight, my first impression of Malaysia was quite different from what I expected. Unlike Taiwan with the spiking smell of brimstone, Malaysia brought back the memory, joyful heat, and friendly sense of the Philippines when I stayed at the English academy.</br>
                    Although Malaysia is well-known as a Muslim country, but personally felt that this country isn't forcing me to notice that they are.</br>
                    What I saw and felt from it was, that aside from how well they naturally put their religious culture into society, I felt this country was the USA within the Asian continent. The way I experienced from the street was that the Chinese, Indians, and Malaysians respected each other and harmonized, instead of fighting and arguing about who was superior.</br>
                    One surprising thing was that KL before midnight gave me a mood very similar to locals anywhere in South Korea. Not as bright and extremely safe as it is here, but it was not as dangerous as I worried before. After all, we went through several night markets, tour spots, and good food, such a great time, and the nice people with nature made my time way too fast that I realized that I was already on the way back home. For those five days, I made a promise to myself to put aside the work of problems that I carry and take a quality of relaxation. And it might not be one hundred percent what I wanted, which I don't think I will ever consider any travel would do, but I guess I had enough to satisfy.</br>
                    A travel to Malaysia to chill, and I'm sure I bring back heartwarming and wholesome memories from there.
