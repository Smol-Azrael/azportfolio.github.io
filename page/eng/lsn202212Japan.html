                	<p>
                        After military service, I couldn't get back to the USA due to the COVID-19 strike and had to carry on with online classes to finish the degree progress. 
                        One day, I came across the chatting with "ExtoNov," a guy from the online that I've known for several years was talking about the plan to visit Japan. 
                        At that moment, I was near the end of the semester and internship so I asked him if I could join the travel. 
                        Surprisingly he accepted my request without hesitation, and at that moment, after five years, I went aboard once again. </br>
						Before we started randomly roaming around, we had to make some sort of "Want to visit this location" list. 
                        So we included Shinjuku, Shibuya, Arakawa, and Akihabara on the list. 
                        And since we were walking most of the moving, we ended up coming across various places and events. 
                        However, without the help of the local friends that Exto brought for his appointment, I wouldn't have even been any closer to some of the exotic or local places and food ever we thought of. </br>
						Since it was like years from the last travel, we "tried" to stick to the plan. 
                        But like any other, we purposely started to get lost on track and rely on pure luck about where we wanted to head, what to encounter, and expect. 
                        When I recall the memories I can have some fun with an hour straight talking about it, and some of them hit harder than others. 
                        Like the grand crosswalk of Shibuya, the collaboration of delicious smoke and fragrant local restaurants from Omoide kocho, the massive building forest of Akihabara area which is well known as the heaven for subculture mania and tech lovers, and the giant curve display that you can see when you head out from east exit of Shinjuku station. Which covers the whole cover floor of the building showing us advertisements and cute cat from time to time. The last thing that comes across my mind is the street of Kabukicho. 
                        It is a very interesting place that you would be surprised how the mood and things will change between noon and after dinner time and a few steps from the main street. </br>
						Now, I’ve tried to organize what I saw and felt, but until this moment it is more like a wave of memory than an arranged and clear vision. 
                        I just assume that this is due to my happiness of myself to get out of the house and see and experience something new and keep recalling the same memory over and over again. 
                        The interesting part is that I remember that we had some bad weather like when it was extremely cold like there would be snow anytime soon but somehow we had to run from getting soaked from heavy rain. 
                        But those were making other memories more vivid and clear somehow.</br>
						As a design aspect, I can only explain “So this is Japanese style and theme, and I don’t know what other word could describe it.” 
                        For now, I guess it is their unique building, language, and design style combined together to generate a whole new theme. 
                        Aside from that, I felt something different is growing within myself. I found that I started to figure out how to approach other people more friendly. 
                        I am unsure when I started this, but I just assume I am affected by Exto’s mad skill of how he doesn’t hesitate to talk to someone he never saw before. 
                        Also, I started to look carefully at other people, like how they express themselves, their fashion, and makeup, wondering where and why they heading toward.</br>
						Surely, it was a great time, and learned something new that I didn’t know I could learn about it.
