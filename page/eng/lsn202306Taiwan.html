                	<p>
                        For this time, we decided to have a concept for the travel and visit here and there. 
                        Also, we promised not to neglect delicious food. 
                        My destination was Kaohsiung, which is famously known as the city of art, and my step was full of joy and eagerness to learn something new.</br>
                        When I arrived in the city, the first thing that hit me was the strong scent of something similar to brimstone and I never going to know what exactly was. 
                        Not surprisingly, those smells were snuck behind my awareness and gave me several surprises from time to time.</br>
                        For the five days of travel, The Pier 2 Art Center was our main target area, and we went around the place we stayed with several night markets on the side. 
                        When I travel around, I often check the packaging of the soft drink or beer can design, cause it usually shows me the traditional and new try of illustration, typo, and layout design at the same time. 
                        And just like a charm, I noticed a little difference in packaging style.</br>
                        For example, by the way this is my opinion, each country has their trend for the packaging. 
                        For, in South Korea, when I check the packaging design, traditionally, they like to bring and emphasize the design in a harmonized with the company into the product. 
                        But when I was doing a little shopping around cities, I felt that they have two different styles going around. </br>
                        The first was a strong typo with visually impactful color, and the other was a simple line art style illustration with chilled pastel colors that almost paled to white. 
                        And some of them were even doing the collabs with anime games like it is nothing special. 
                        Speaking of the anime subculture, I was also shocked that one of the official government departments was adapting the anime style to the guidance and other information boards to help the mood be more friendly to younger ages.</br>
                        The other thing I noticed was how Kanji was making a similar mood that I felt in Japan, and how different they are feeling from other alphabets like Korean and English. 
                        From Japan, I felt more organized, but here in Taiwan, it was more rough in a good way.</br>
                        The Pier 2 Art Center has two different faces on its own. 
                        Quite and chilled artistic during a weekday, gathered up and joyful during the weekend. 
                        Their adapting to new challenges, friendly to others, and never-ending new showcase was making this place to revisit several more times and highly recommend to others. 
                        Within the large area, warehouses were lined up and various themes of stores, restaurants, cafes, and exhibitions were there and felt like they were promising that they would provide a new experience whenever I came back to visit this place again.
